This is the first C++ Project I created entirely on my own. I went into this project with no knowledge of how to handle files in C++ and this led to a great deal of research. One of the biggest struggles was adding the task numbering functionality. It was easy to make it keep track of when adding tasks, however, once tasks were deleted the numbers would be off. Then I ran into an issue when reading the tasks into a vector, it was reading the numbers as well which would cause them to write to the file as a 5-6 digit integer. 
In the end I feel as though this was a valuable learning experience and I am satisfied with the end result.
